## The Dataset

The MAPBIOMAS project gathers data reporting the type of land covering each year by area, that is, for example, the area used for a temporary crop of soybeans. It also reports the transition between coverings during given years.

The data available has an yearly frequency and is available starting from the year 1989.

## Usage
Using the function is easy enough:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(datazoom.amazonia)
```
