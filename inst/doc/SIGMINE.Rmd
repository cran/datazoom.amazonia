## The Dataset

The SIGMINE project gathers data reporting each mine in the country and their features such as year, area in square meters, company ownership, element being explored etc.


## Usage
Using the function is easy enough:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(datazoom.amazonia)

# download raw data
sigmine_active <- load_sigmine(dataset = 'sigmine_active',
                               raw_data = TRUE)
```
